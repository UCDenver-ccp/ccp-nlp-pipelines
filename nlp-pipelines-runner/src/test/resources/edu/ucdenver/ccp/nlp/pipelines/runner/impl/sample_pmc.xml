        <p>Mutations in the <italic>PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)</italic> gene cause an autosomal recessive form of Parkinson disease (PD). So far, no substrates of PINK1 have been reported, and the mechanism by which PINK1 mutations lead to neurodegeneration is unknown. Here we report the identification of TNF receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), a mitochondrial molecular chaperone also known as heat shock protein 75 (Hsp75), as a cellular substrate for PINK1 kinase. PINK1 binds and colocalizes with TRAP1 in the mitochondria and phosphorylates TRAP1 both in vitro and in vivo. We show that PINK1 protects against oxidative-stress-induced cell death by suppressing cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and this protective action of PINK1 depends on its kinase activity to phosphorylate TRAP1. Moreover, we find that the ability of PINK1 to promote TRAP1 phosphorylation and cell survival is impaired by PD-linked PINK1 G309D, L347P, and W437X mutations. Our findings suggest a novel pathway by which PINK1 phosphorylates downstream effector TRAP1 to prevent oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis and implicate the dysregulation of this mitochondrial pathway in PD pathogenesis.</p>

          <p>Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by the selective loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Although the cause of PD is unknown, pathological analyses have suggested the involvement of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Recently, an inherited form of early-onset PD has been linked to mutations in both copies of the gene encoding the mitochondrial protein PINK1. Furthermore, increasing evidence indicates that single-copy mutations in PINK1 are a significant risk factor in the development of later-onset PD. Here we show that PINK1 is a protein kinase that phosphorylates the mitochondrial molecular chaperone TRAP1 to promote cell survival. We find that PINK1 normally protects against oxidative-stress-induced cell death by suppressing cytochrome c release from mitochondria. The PINK1 mutations linked to PD impair the ability of PINK1 to phosphorylate TRAP1 and promote cell survival. Our findings reveal a novel anti-apoptotic signaling pathway that is disrupted by mutations in PINK1. We suggest that this pathway has a role in PD pathogenesis and may be a target for therapeutic intervention.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b001">1</xref>]. The cause of PD, particularly the sporadic disease, is unclear, but it likely involves both genetic and environmental factors. Genetic studies have identified a number of genes associated with familial PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b002">2</xref>]. Postmortem analyses reveal a deficiency in the mitochondrial complex I function in patients with sporadic PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b003">3</xref>]. Furthermore, exposure to environmental toxins that inhibit the mitochondrial complex I can lead to PD-like phenotypes in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b004">4</xref>], suggesting the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD pathogenesis.</p>
      <p>Mutations in the <italic>PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)</italic> gene were originally discovered in three pedigrees with recessively inherited PD. Two homozygous <italic>PINK1</italic> mutations were initially identified: a truncating nonsense mutation (W437X) and a G309D missense mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b005">5</xref>]. Subsequently, multiple additional types of PD-linked mutations or truncations in <italic>PINK1</italic> have been reported, making <italic>PINK1</italic> the second most common causative gene of recessive PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b007">7</xref>]. Interestingly, despite autosomal recessive transmission of <italic>PINK1</italic>-linked early-onset PD, a number of heterozygous mutations affecting only one <italic>PINK1</italic> allele have been associated with late-onset PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b010">10</xref>]. The pathogenic mechanisms by which <italic>PINK1</italic> mutations lead to neurodegeneration are unknown.</p>
      <p><italic>PINK1</italic> encodes a 581-amino-acid protein with a predicted N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence and a conserved serine/threonine kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b005">5</xref>]. PINK1 protein has been shown to localize in the mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b013">13</xref>] and exhibit autophosphorylation activity in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b014">14</xref>]. The in vivo substrate(s) and biochemical function of PINK1 remain unknown. In cultured mammalian cells, overexpression of wild-type PINK1 protects cells against apoptotic stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b015">15</xref>], whereas small interfering RNA (siRNA)–mediated depletion of PINK1 increases the susceptibility to apoptotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b016">16</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> loss of PINK1 leads to mitochondrial defects and degeneration of muscle and dopaminergic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b020">20</xref>]. Despite ample evidence indicating an essential role of PINK1 in cytoprotection, the mechanism by which PINK1 protects against apoptosis is not understood.</p>
      <p>Here, we describe the characterization of mitochondrial serine/threonine kinase PINK1 and report the identification of TNF receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), a mitochondrial molecular chaperone also known as heat shock protein 75 (Hsp75), as a PINK1 substrate. Our results suggest that PINK1 protects against oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis by phosphorylating downstream effector TRAP1, and provide novel insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of PINK1 mutations in causing PD.</p>

        <title>PINK1 Interacts with TRAP1</title>
        <p>To identify PINK1-interacting proteins, we performed affinity purification experiments using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel to isolate proteins associated with C-terminally FLAG-tagged human wild-type PINK1 from transfected HeLa cell extracts. Consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b012">12</xref>], Western blot analysis detected a 63-kDa full-length form (PINK1f) and a 52-kDa processed form (PINK1p) of PINK1 protein in the cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g001">Figure 1</xref>A<italic>,</italic> “Input”). Both forms of PINK1 were eluted from the affinity column in fractions 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Ponceau S staining of the affinity-purified PINK1 immune complexes revealed the presence of several proteins that were specifically associated with PINK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Mass spectrometry analysis unambiguously identified the 75-kDa PINK1-associated protein as TRAP1, a ubiquitously expressed protein with significant sequence homology to the HSP90AA1 family of molecular chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b023">23</xref>].</p>

        </fig>
        <p>In order to characterize endogenous PINK1 protein and its interaction with TRAP1, we generated a rabbit polyclonal anti-PINK1 antibody against amino acid residues 135–155 of human PINK1. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the anti-PINK1 antibody, but not the preimmune serum, specifically recognized endogenous PINK1 as well as recombinant wild-type and mutant PINK1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g001">Figure 1</xref>C; additional data not shown). Using this anti-PINK1 antibody, we found that both the full-length and the processed forms of endogenous PINK1 co-immunoprecipitated with TRAP1 in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g001">Figure 1</xref>D), confirming that the identified PINK1–TRAP1 interaction occurs in vivo. We then assessed the interaction of TRAP1 with PD-linked PINK1 mutants (G309D, W437X, and L347P) and with putative catalytically inactive PINK1 mutants (K219A, D362A, D384A, and the triple mutant K219A/D362A/D384A [KDD]). None of the PINK1 mutations examined had any significant effect on the ability of PINK1 to bind TRAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g001">Figure 1</xref>E).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2b">
        <title>PINK1 Colocalizes with TRAP1 in the Mitochondria</title>
        <p>Next, we analyzed the intracellular distribution and colocalization of PINK1 and TRAP1 by using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. PINK1 and TRAP1 both contain a predicted mitochondria targeting signal at their N-terminus, and a mitochondrial localization has previously been reported for PINK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b012">12</xref>] as well as for TRAP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b023">23</xref>]. In agreement with the earlier studies, we found that both PINK1 and TRAP1 proteins are localized to the mitochondria labeled by MitoTracker (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050172-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Moreover, double labeling immunocytochemistry analysis revealed a substantial overlap between PINK1 and TRAP1 staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050172-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), suggesting that these two proteins colocalize in the mitochondria.</p>
        <p>To complement our immunocytochemistry data, we used subcellular fractionation to characterize the intracellular distribution of PINK1 and TRAP1. Western blot analysis showed a clear co-fractionation of endogenous PINK1 and TRAP1 on a 5%–15% linear Optiprep gradient with mitochondria marker TIMM23, but not with endoplasmic reticulum marker CANX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Further fractionation studies of the isolated mitochondria revealed that endogenous PINK1 and TRAP1 were both primarily found in the mitochondrial inner membrane and intermembrane space fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Together, these results provide strong support for an in vivo association of PINK1 with TRAP1 in the mitochondria. Similar analyses of PC12 cells expressing wild-type PINK1 or PD-linked G309D, W437X, and L347P mutant PINK1 showed that the mitochondrial colocalization of PINK1 with TRAP1 was not affected by the pathogenic PINK1 mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050172-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

        <title>PINK1 Phosphorylates TRAP1, and the Kinase Activity Is Abrogated by PD-linked Mutations</title>
        <p>Our finding of a specific interaction and colocalization between TRAP1 and PINK1 raises the possibility that TRAP1 may be a substrate of PINK1 kinase. To examine this possibility, we performed in vitro kinase assays to investigate the ability of wild-type and mutant PINK1 to phosphorylate TRAP1. We observed a robust phosphorylation of TRAP1 by wild-type PINK1, as shown by the PINK1-mediated transfer of <sup>32</sup>P from [γ-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP to the TRAP1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Computer modeling analysis of the PINK1 kinase domain suggests that the amino acid residues K219, D362, and D384 might be key determinants of PINK1 catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b011">11</xref>]. To test this prediction, we assessed the effects of single or triple mutations of these residues to alanines (K219A, D362A, D384A, or KDD) on the kinase activity of PINK1 in phosphorylating TRAP1. Although K219A mutation had no significant effect on the PINK1 kinase activity, the D362A, D384A, and KDD triple mutations dramatically reduced PINK1 activity in phosphorylating TRAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g003">3</xref>B). Analysis of the effects of PD-linked PINK1 mutations on the in vitro phosphorylation of TRAP1 revealed that the pathogenic mutation G309D or L347P virtually abolished the kinase activity of PINK1. In contrast, the kinase activity of PINK1 was not significantly affected by the W437X mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g003">3</xref>B).</p>

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g003">Figure 3</xref>C, we observed a low basal level of TRAP1 phosphorylation in untransfected PC12 cells. TRAP1 phosphorylation was significantly increased in response to oxidative stress induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Overexpression of wild-type PINK1 resulted in a 3.3-fold increase in the basal level of TRAP1 phosphorylation and a 2.2-fold increase in oxidative-stress-induced TRAP1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g003">3</xref>D). The ability of PINK1 to promote in vivo TRAP1 phosphorylation was abolished by the PD-linked PINK1 mutations G309D and L347P. In fact, cells overexpressing G309D or L347P mutant PINK1 had approximately 50% lower levels of both basal and oxidative-stress-induced TRAP1 phosphorylation than the untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050172-g003">3</xref>D).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Although mutations in the putative kinase PINK1 are a common cause of autosomal recessive PD, very little is known about the biological function of PINK1 and how loss of PINK1 function leads to neurodegeneration. The present study demonstrates that PINK1 is a mitochondrial serine/threonine kinase with a critical role in promoting cell survival. We have identified what is to our knowledge the first substrate for the PINK1 kinase: the mitochondrial molecular chaperone TRAP1. Our findings reveal a hitherto unexplored pathway by which PINK1 phosphorylates downstream effector TRAP1 to protect cells against apoptosis, and suggest a link between the impairment of this novel mitochondrial pathway and neurodegeneration in PD.</p>
      <p>It has become increasingly clear that molecular chaperones not only facilitate protein folding, but also regulate a number of cellular processes, including cell survival and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b025">25</xref>]. Despite the critical importance of mitochondria in cell function and survival, the current knowledge about mitochondrial molecular chaperones is limited. TRAP1 is a poorly characterized mitochondrial protein with significant sequence homology to the HSP90AA1 family of molecular chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b023">23</xref>]. Our finding that siRNA-mediated depletion of TRAP1 sensitizes cells to oxidative-stress-induced cytochrome c release and cell death suggests a role for TRAP1 in the modulation of the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade. Consistent with this role, TRAP1 knockdown has been shown to enhance cytochrome c release and apoptosis induced by other stressors, such as protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor β-hydroxyisovalerylshikonin and topoisomerase II inhibitor VP16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b026">26</xref>]. The molecular basis of the anti-apoptotic function of TRAP1 remains unknown. Although we find that TRAP1 and cytochrome c colocalize in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, our results indicate that TRAP1 does not physically associate with cytochrome c in cells either in the absence or presence of oxidative stress. Thus, TRAP1 may inhibit the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria through a mechanism other than direct interaction/retention. Future studies are required to elucidate the mechanism by which TRAP1 regulates cytochrome c release and apoptosis.</p>
      <p>Our data reveal that endogenous TRAP1 is constitutively phosphorylated at low levels, and the TRAP1 phosphorylation is significantly increased in response to oxidative stress induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Both constitutive and oxidative-stress-induced TRAP1 phosphorylation are dramatically enhanced by PINK1 overexpression and are reduced by siRNA-mediated depletion of PINK1, indicating that PINK1 is a major kinase responsible for phosphorylating TRAP1 in cells. These results, together with the in vitro phosphorylation data, provide compelling evidence that TRAP1 is a bona fide substrate for PINK1 kinase. We find that overexpression of PINK1 protects cells against oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis by suppressing cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and this protective action of PINK1 depends on its kinase activity to phosphorylate TRAP1. Conversely, PINK1 depletion causes increased cytochrome c release from mitochondria and sensitizes cells to oxidative-stress-induced cell death, and the pro-apoptotic effect of PINK1 depletion correlates with reduced TRAP1 phosphorylation. Moreover, our studies using TRAP1 siRNAs have provided direct evidence that TRAP1 is required for PINK1-mediated protection against oxidative-stress-induced cytochrome c release and cell death. Collectively, these findings point to a specific pathway in which PINK1 exerts its cytoprotective function by phosphorylating downstream effector TRAP1 to inhibit the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.</p>
      <p>Our work indicates that the mitochondrial PINK1–TRAP1 anti-apoptotic pathway is disrupted by PD-linked PINK1 G309D, L347P, and W437X mutations. Previous studies of PINK1 mutations using in vitro autophosphorylation assays and artificial kinase substrates have led to conflicting results. For example, analyses with recombinant GST-fused PINK1 proteins purified from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> showed that PINK1 autophosphorylation activity was slightly decreased by the G309D mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b012">12</xref>] and was significantly increased by the W437X mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b012">12</xref>] and that neither of these mutations affected the activity of PINK1 to phosphorylate artificial substrate α-casein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b012">12</xref>]. In contrast, a recent study using recombinant PINK1 proteins isolated from baculovirus-infected <italic>sf9</italic> insect cells failed to detect PINK1 autophosphorylation activity, but showed that PINK1 C-terminal truncation reduced the activity of PINK1 to phosphorylate artificial substrate histone H1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b027">27</xref>]. These discrepancies underscore the importance of knowing physiological substrate(s) for characterizing the kinase function of wild-type and mutant PINK1. Our analyses reveal that single G309D and L347P mutations abolish the kinase activity of PINK1 to phosphorylate its physiological substrate TRAP1 both in vitro and in vivo. By comparison, the W437X mutation has a weaker effect on PINK1-mediated TRAP1 phosphorylation. Our findings that PD-linked mutations impair the ability of PINK1 to promote TRAP1 phosphorylation and cell survival provide strong support for a loss-of-function pathogenic mechanism in familial PD patients carrying homozygous PINK1 mutations.</p>
      <p>Recently, an increasing number of PD cases with heterozygous mutations affecting only one <italic>PINK1</italic> allele have been reported, including single heterozygous G309D and W437X mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b010">10</xref>]. Our results that PD-linked PINK1 mutations specifically inhibit PINK1 kinase function without affecting the substrate binding or subcellular localization of PINK1 raise an interesting possibility that these mutants may act in a dominant negative manner to inhibit the function of the normal <italic>PINK1</italic> allele by competing with endogenous wild-type PINK1 for binding its substrate TRAP1. In support of this possibility, we find that PD-linked PINK1 G309D and L347P mutations have a dominant negative effect on in vivo TRAP1 phosphorylation and cell survival. These results suggest a dominant negative pathogenic mechanism by which heterozygous PINK1 mutations lead to Parkinsonian symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050172-b009">9</xref>]. By comparison, overexpression studies show that the W437X mutation has a smaller but significant inhibitory effect on in vivo TRAP1 phosphorylation and cell survival, providing evidence supporting a pathogenic role of the heterozygous W437X mutation. Our finding of a mitochondrial PINK1–TRAP1 anti-apoptotic pathway and its impairment by PD-linked mutations provides new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of PD and suggests novel targets for therapeutic intervention.</p>
